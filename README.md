# t2r-reposter

This bot watches some specified account on Twitter for a new post and then
posts the contents of that post to a specific subreddit.

This bot is current WIP, so using this code would not be recommended.

## Install

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

## TODO:

- [ ] Get credentials for a Twitter app which will use the Twitter API to fetch new posts from a user.
- [ ] Create a new Reddit app and get credentials for usage with Reddit API.
- [ ] Make the bot itself.
- [ ] Write some tests.
- [ ] Setup a deployment to some hosting provider (probably Heroku).
